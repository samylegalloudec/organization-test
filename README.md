# Organization project

This project is meant to create a full architecture that can be used in a big organisation.

## Technical stack :

I want to use data coming from an API. Probably going to use JCDecaux, i don't know which one to use yet. For that use, i'm going to use Apache Kafka.

I'm then going to use Apache Spark to do the ETL

And store it in a Hadoop Cluster.
